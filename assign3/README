# Lab 4

### How to Run?
> 1. make   

> 2. cd src

Exactly like prev assignments (assuming build.xml is run with ant)
> 3. Start mininet, pox and VirtualNetwork.jar (router) 

Then, in h2's xterm (receiver):
> 4. java TCPend -p 6008 -m 512 -c 4 -f sendFile_received2.md

Then, in h1's xterm (sender)
> 5. java TCPend -p 6007 -s 10.0.2.102 -a 6008 -f sendfile.md -m 512 -c 4 


**NOTE:** Open receiver connection first!
