Q3.2 

Expectation -
latency: 80.661 (avg latency of L1) + 20.618 (avg latency L2) + 60.582 (avg latency L3) = 161.861 ms
throughput: minimum of receiving throughputs across L1, L2, L3 => min (18.937 (L1), 38.065 (L2), 28.465 (L3)) = 18.98 Mbps

Measurements -
latency: 160.919 ms
throughput (receiving): 18.665 Mbps

Expectation matched the measurement!
